## Secret Chat

**Send secret messages with a fun twist!** Secret Chat lets you encrypt messages using a simple substitution cipher(GA-DE-RY-PO-LU-KI). Encode your message with a click, then share it with your friends for a fun way to communicate in secret. Easily copy the encrypted message or clear everything to start fresh. Remember, this is a basic encryption method and shouldn't be used for top-secret messages.
